# GitHub Actions OIDC identity provider. This is what lets a workflow exchange a
# short-lived GitHub token for AWS credentials, so nothing in CI ever holds a
# static access key.
#
# The provider is account-global. In a shared account it usually already exists
# (another project created it), so by default this module looks it up rather than
# owning it: that keeps a bootstrap teardown from deleting a provider other
# projects depend on. In a fresh account, set create_github_oidc_provider = true.
